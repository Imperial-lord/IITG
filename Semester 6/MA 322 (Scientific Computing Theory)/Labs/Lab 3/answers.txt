Question 4.
(i) Thus, the approximation of g(0.25) using direct interpolation = P(0.25) = 3.864718750000005
	The error term is at x = 0.25 is 0.0468796874999999

(i) Thus, the approximation of g(0.25) using interpolation on xg(x) table = P(0.25) = 3.9584725
	The error term is at x = 0.25 is 5.62499999994317e-6

(iii) Since the differences in (i) are oscillating and are not decreasing fast, the resulting error in interpolation would be large.
	However, the differences in (ii) tend to become smaller in magnitude, we expect more accurate results in this case.
	
	
	
Question 5.
(i) The value of P(-2) = -1
	The value of P(-1) = 3
	The value of P(0) = 1
	The value of P(1) = -1
	The value of P(2) = 3

	The value of Q(-2) = -1
	The value of Q(-1) = 3
	The value of Q(0) = 1
	The value of Q(1) = -1
	The value of Q(2) = 3

	Thus, both cubic polynomails P(x) and Q(x) interpolate the given data

(ii) Simplifying P(x) we get x**3 - 3*x + 1
	Simplifying Q(x) we get x**3 - 3*x + 1
	Since we can clearly see that P(x) = Q(x), this ensures that the uniqueness property of interpolating polynmials is not violated
	


Question 6.
As we can simply observe, if all 4th order forward differences are 1, this means
All 5th order forward differences will be 0, in other words degree of polynmial is 4
The polynmial is thus given as 
         4          3         2
0.04167 x - 0.9167 x + 2.958 x + 2.917 x + 4
Clearly, the coefficient of x^3 is -0.9166666666666666 or -11/12



Question 7.
Using P(x) we find the following:
f[x0,x1,x2,x3] = 16/3
f[x0,x1,x2] = 4
f[x0,x1] = 4
f[x0] = 1

Using the above information and simple arithmetic, the divided differences table is obtained as follows:
x		f
-------------------------------------------------------------------
0		1	 	 	 	
0.25	2		4	 	 	
0.5		3.5		6		4	 	
0.75	6		10		8	5.333333333333333	

Clearly, from the above table, we get f(0.75) = 6
