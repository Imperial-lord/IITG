    %   A function program to implement Bisection Method
    %{
        The traditional bisection method is a tool to find
        a root of a polynomial p(x) in an interval which makes repeated use of the fact
        that given a continuous function f on an interval [a, b], such that f (a) and f (b) 
        are of opposite sign, there exists at least one c âˆˆ (a, b) such that f (c) = 0.
